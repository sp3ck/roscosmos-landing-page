# roscosmos-landing-page
A landing page for a russian rocket company called Roscosmos, cause I love rockets.

Also part of my third FCC's responsive web design project, building a product landing page.

This landing page was built by utilizing only HTML/CSS.

Ill like to make all the links more dynamic with hover animation and what nots. Also, id like to add some animation or dynamicity to the feature page and product page. Finally maybe addidng a simple space invader game at the contact us page would be fun. Also, wana do some sort of parallax bg img kinda transition when moving between oages but i guess i need to learn javascript for that. 

Also, i should add icons to nav menu and design an animated background for the product page similar to some of the retro videogames and the rocket images should jitter left-right, up and down.

hmm, ill improve these as soon i lock down javascript!
